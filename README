Feedasaurus Rails
=================

A prototype Google Reader replacement written in Rails. The final app
will have a modular structure and may not even use Rails.

As this is a prototype, this project is largely in flux, so things like
database migrations will be modified in place, rather than with new
migrations modifying existing structure.
