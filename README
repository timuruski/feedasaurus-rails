Feedasaurus Rails
=================

A prototype Google Reader replacement written in Rails. The final app
will have a modular structure and may not even use Rails.

As this is a prototype, this project is largely in flux, so things like
database migrations will be modified in place, rather than with new
migrations modifying existing structure.


## Dependencies

The data store is PostgreSQL 9.2.3. The application runs two processes,
a web process for the in-browser scaffolding and a worker process to
handle refreshing feeds.

## Setting up

Rake tasks are included for managing feeds.

    $ rake feeds:list
    $ rake feeds:search[ars technica]
    $ rake feeds:show[123]

Feeds can be imported from an OPML file exported by Google Reader.

    $ rake feeds:import[feeds.xml]

To update a feed, it can be scheduled for refresh by the worker
process.

    $ rake feeds:refresh_all

A feed can also be immediately updated with the following Rake tasks.

    $ rake feeds:refresh[123]
    $ rake feeds:refresh_all_now
